## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar levels. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature selection.
- **Model Training:** Training various deep learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Prediction:** Making predictions on new data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
