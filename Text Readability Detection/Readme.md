## Introduction

Readability detection is an important aspect of content creation, especially in educational contexts. This project utilizes various NLP methods to assess and classify text based on its readability level. The goal is to make content more accessible by ensuring it matches the intended audience's reading level.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, and other preprocessing steps.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting features like word count, sentence length, syllable count, etc.
- **Model Training:** Training machine learning models to predict readability scores or levels.
- **Evaluation:** Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, etc.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for this project consists of text samples labeled with their corresponding readability scores.
