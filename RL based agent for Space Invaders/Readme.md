# RL-based Agent for Space Invaders

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The agent is trained using deep learning techniques to maximize its score by learning optimal strategies for shooting invaders and avoiding obstacles.

## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning has become a powerful tool in developing intelligent agents capable of playing games autonomously. In this project, an RL-based agent is designed to play Space Invaders, a game where the player controls a ship that must destroy waves of aliens while dodging their attacks.

## Approach

- **Environment:** The game environment is provided by OpenAI Gym, which simulates the Space Invaders arcade game.
- **Algorithm:** The agent is trained using a deep Q-learning algorithm (DQN) or a policy gradient method like PPO.
- **Training:** The agent interacts with the game environment, learning from rewards and penalties to improve its performance over time.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. **Setup the Environment:**
   - Install the required libraries and dependencies.

2. **Training the Agent:**
   - Run the training script to start training the RL agent on the Space Invaders environment.
   - Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate to fine-tune the training process.

3. **Testing the Agent:**
   - Once the agent is trained, run the test script to see how well it performs in the game.
   - The agent's performance can be visualized through game playbacks or score plots.

## Results

- **Highest Score Achieved:** 175
- **Training Time:** 3 days
- **Algorithm Performance:** Charts and graphs illustrating the agent's learning progress over time.
